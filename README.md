# Harden-Windows-Security

## Harden Windows 11 Safely, securely and without breaking anything 
  

*This is suitable for tech-savvy and non-tech-savvy users and it is recommended to be run and applied to every Windows system.*
  

Above each command there are comments (lines starting with `#` or `<#` are comments in PowerShell) that explain what it does and I provided links to additional resources where necessary to help understand it better. 
  

This script will be kept up-to-date. always tested on latest available version of Windows (stable and insider builds) 
  

This script should be run for each user individually to be effective. admins should run it with Administrator privileges and standard users run it with standard privileges, in PowerShell. 

  
This script can be run infinite number of times without causing any problem, it does not make any duplicate modification. 
  

Things with **#TopSecurity** tag can break functionalities or cause difficulties so this script does NOT enable them by default. press Control + F and search for #TopSecurity in the script to find those commands and how to enable them if you want. 
  

When the script is running for the first time, please keep an eye on the PowerShell console because you might need to provide input for Bitlocker activation etc. 
  

This script is available and mirrored on both PowerShell Gallery and GitHub

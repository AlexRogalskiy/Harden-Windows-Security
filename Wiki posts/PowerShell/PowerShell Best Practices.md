# PowerShell Best Practices To Follow When Coding

It is important to follow best practices when coding in PowerShell to ensure that your codes are efficient, maintainable, and secure.

<br>

## Specify The Variable Types Explicitly

ðŸš« Don't do this
```powershell
$Var = 5
```

âœ… Do this instead
```powershell
[System.Int32]$Var = 5
```

<br>

## Use Full Type Names Instead of Type Accelerators

ðŸš« Don't do this
```powershell
[String]$Var = 'Hello'
```

âœ… Do this instead
```powershell
[System.String]$Var = 'Hello'
```

<br>

## Use Single Quotes Instead of Double Quotes Unless Absolutely Necessary

ðŸš« Don't do this
```powershell
$Var = "Hello"
```

âœ… Do this instead
```powershell
$Var = 'Hello'
```

This is because double quotes allow for string interpolation, which can be a security risk if the string is not sanitized properly and also slightly slower than single quotes.

## Use Full Cmdlet Names Instead of Aliases

ðŸš« Don't do this
```powershell
Gci
cls
```

âœ… Do this instead
```powershell
Get-ChildItem
Clear-Host
```

<br>

## Use Pascal Casing for Everything

ðŸš« Don't do this
```powershell
$myvariable
get-childitem
new-item
```

ðŸš« or this (camelCase)

```powershell
$myVariable
get-ChildItem
new-Item
```


âœ… Do this instead
```powershell
$MyVariable
Get-ChildItem
New-Item
```

<br>

## Use Regions to Organize Your Code

âœ… Using regions like this allows you to collapse and expand sections of your code for better readability.

```powershell
#Region Functions
function Get-MyFunction1 {
    # Function code here
}
function Get-MyFunction2 {
    # Function code here
}
function Get-MyFunction3 {
    # Function code here
}
#EndRegion
```

<br>

## Use Visual Studio Code PowerShell Extension For Automatic Best Practice Formatting

You can access the settings page of [PowerShell extension in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/powershell) and enable options that automatically apply some of the aforementioned best practices when you format your code with (CTRL + Shift + F) shortcut.

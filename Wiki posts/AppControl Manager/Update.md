# Update

In the [AppControl Manager's](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/AppControl-Manager) update page you can configure the app to automatically check for updates at startup. Alternatively, you can manually check for updates or customize the update behavior to use a hardened update procedure for enhanced security.

Additionally, you can select an MSIX package to install as an update for AppControl Manager. This feature is particularly useful if you've already downloaded the MSIX file from GitHub or built the application from the source code yourself.

The update experience is very convenient and non-intrusive because when the app is updated, it won't restart itself, instead it will wait for you to close it and the next time you open it you will be automatically using the new version.

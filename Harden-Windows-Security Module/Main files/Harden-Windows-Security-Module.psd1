## Version 0.0.8
The compliance checking module now uses registry instead of group policy, this was done because group policies are different in different languages and locales so the old method couldn't be used by users using non-English system locales.
This also saves about 1000 lines of code, makes compliance checking faster and generates more detailed output.
Overall it's a very positive change.

## Version 0.0.7
Changed the Hyper-V Administrators security group members detection from using name to SID to make it compatible with non-English system locales.
Improved the code security and readability by adding explicit types to many variables and using single quotes instead of double quotes wherever possible.

## Version 0.0.6
Fixed the URL for Group-Policies.json

## Version 0.0.5
Small update to improve the auto-updating mechanism

## Version 0.0.4
Updated the Compliance checks to include changes in the following Harden Windows Security update:
https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/releases/tag/v2023.08.08
Changed Windows Firewall category from using cmdlets to Group policy xml parsing

## Version 0.0.3
Updated the Compliance checks to include changes in the following Harden Windows Security update:
https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/releases/tag/v2023.08.04

## Version 0.0.2
Added self-updating mechanism
Added all the missing categories such as Optional Windows Features category and Top Security category
Added Bitlocker DMA protection check
Fixed the CSV output to stop repeating the headers for each category
Improved the ASCII arts and their colors
Added Total number of checks to the output
Improved the displayed output to include checks that do not output bool value by adding an extra property called Compliant to each item
Improved the module's PowerShell gallery page (Description, image)
Added a new optional parameter called "-DetailedDisplay" to show the output in a detailed list instead of the default table format

## Version 0.0.1
